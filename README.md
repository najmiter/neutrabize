# neutrabize

**neutrabize**: A Chrome extension to customise the new tab.

## Features

We currently have the following

-   Change background image
-   Change the theme color
-   Show current weather based on your location (fetches every hour, not every reload)
-   Toggle animation (nothing fancy, just a meteor like div falls every 3 seconds)
-   Hide or show the shortcuts (can't edit them yet)

All of **these settings will remain consistent even after you reload**. Only when you clear the browser cache or do any sort of system reset.

Future features involve much more customisations and improvements.
